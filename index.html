                        I am a 25 year old developer, living in Cleveland. I attended University School, a private all boys high school in the Area. I then went to Lehigh University and studied financial economics.

                        After a year of travel and soul-searching I decided i wanted to study and code around cryptocurrencies, specifically Ethereum. I believe the long term cryptocurrencies will impact the world as much as computers and the Internet have.

                        I am currently in a coding bootcamp at Case Western University, and studying the Solidity contract scripting language on my own time.
